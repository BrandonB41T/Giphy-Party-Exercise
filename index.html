<!-- 
We’ve provided a starter HTML file, but there’s next to nothing in the body. Start by building a simple form with an input for a search term and a submit button. When the user submits the form, use axios to make a request to GIPHY for information based on that term. After receiving the response, ***console.log*** the response data to make sure you’re getting back what you expect.

For example, here is what the AJAX request URL would look like for search   term of “hilarious”: http://api.giphy.com/v1/gifs/search?q=hilarious&  api_key=MhAodEJIJxQMxW9XqxKjyXfNYdLoOIym. You can click on this URL and   see the JSON you will get back. To view this in a nicer format, we highly   recommend using the JSON Viewer chrome extension. This is also the data   you should console.log when the form is submitted. -->
